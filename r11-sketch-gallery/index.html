    <p>Pick Paint Pattern is designed for the users to interact with the work on their
        own and literally become the artist themselves. The user can use the mouse to press on any location of the
        canvas for the monster in the middle of the canvas to spit out a ball to that pressed location. Then, the user
        has the option to press the “A” key while pressing with the mouse to make a pattern on the pressed square. As
        soon as the ball reaches the pressed destination, it will disappear or simply explode to make an abstract
        particle pattern that could be interpreted as anything depending on the viewer. </p>
